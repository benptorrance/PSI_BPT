#    How to run:
#       All you would need to do is download the .zip file and extract. Then you would need to run the sln file with
#    Visual Studio 2019 and hit the run button. However, I have noticed that downloading it from Github causes the program to be 
#    unable to write to the csv file the first one or two times. There is a MessageBox that should pop up telling you that it 
#    has written to the data.csv file.
