#    How to run:
       All you would need to do is download the .zip file and extract. Then you would need to run the sln file with
     Visual Studio 2019 and hit the run button. However, I have noticed that downloading it from Github causes the program to be 
     unable to write to the csv file the first one or two times. There is a MessageBox that should pop up telling you that it 
     has written to the data.csv file.

#    Trouble Shooting:
       Delete and remake the data.csv file. For some reason, it has a problem writing to the .csv, however after remaking the file it will      write to it properly. It can write to the file multiple times after that.
